Hi! My name is Richmond, welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a

becoming a software engineer. Currently my portfolio showcases some
projects I have completed or colaborated on so far. In the contact me section it will link you to my github profile, there you can also see other projects I have worked on! Thank you for taking a look!
